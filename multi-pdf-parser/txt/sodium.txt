For disposal see section 13. 

 
7. HANDLING AND STORAGE 

7.1 

Precautions for safe handling 
Avoid formation of dust and aerosols.Further processing of solid materials may result in the formation of combustible 
dusts. The potential for combustible dust formation should be taken into consideration before additional processing 
occurs. 
Provide appropriate exhaust ventilation at places where dust is formed.Keep away from sources of ignition - No smoking. 
For precautions see section 2.2. 

7.2  Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities 
Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place.

Respiratory protection 
Where risk assessment shows air-purifying respirators are appropriate use a full-face particle respirator type 
N100 (US) or type P3 (EN 143) respirator cartridges as a backup to engineering controls. If the respirator is the 
sole means of protection, use a full-face supplied air respirator. Use respirators and components tested and 
approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN (EU). 

Control of environmental exposure 
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Do not let product enter drains.
