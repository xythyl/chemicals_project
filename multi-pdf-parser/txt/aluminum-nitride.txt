EN374 
If used in solution, or mixed with other substances, and under conditions which differ from EN 374, contact the 
supplier of the CE approved gloves. This recommendation is advisory only and must be evaluated by an 
industrial hygienist and safety officer familiar with the specific situation of anticipated use by our customers. It 
should not be construed as offering an approval for any specific use scenario. 
 
Body Protection 
Complete suit protecting against chemicals, The type of protective equipment must be selected according to 
the concentration and amount of the dangerous substance at the specific workplace. 

Respiratory protection 
Where risk assessment shows air-purifying respirators are appropriate use a full-face particle respirator type 
N100 (US) or type P3 (EN 143) respirator cartridges as a backup to engineering controls. If the respirator is the 
sole means of protection, use a full-face supplied air respirator. Use respirators and components tested and 
approved under appropriate government standards such as NIOSH (US) or CEN (EU). 

Control of environmental exposure 
Do not let product enter drains.
